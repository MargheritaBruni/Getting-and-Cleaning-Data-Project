## Variables 
There are 79 movements variable means and standard deviation per row.
Each row is a subject.
* Subjects are identified with an integer (1-30)
Activity identified include walking, walking upstairs or downstairs, sitting, standing, laying

* Time mesures as floating point are provided in the X, Y and Z axis:
** mean and standard deviation body acceleration 
** mean and standard deviation gravity acceleration 
** Mean and standard deviation of body acceleration jerk 
** Mean and standard deviation of body rotation speed and magnitude  
* Frequency measures in the X, Y and Z directions include:
** mean and standard deviation body acceleration
** mean and standard deviation of the jerk
** mean and standard deviation of body rotation speed and magnitude
 
 
## Transformations

* Variables extraction on merged training and test data set
