# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
Submission requirements include:
1) a tidy data set,
2) a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis, 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations  performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
